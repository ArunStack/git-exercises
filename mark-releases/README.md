# Mark releases with tags
You have pretty long history of your product. You have even released three major versions of it, that is `1.0.0`, `2.0.0` and `3.0.0`.

However, you forgot to tag them appropriately which makes it very difficult to checkout specific version. 
Your task is to find commits with releases and mark them.
