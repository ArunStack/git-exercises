git reflog
# inspect what you want to checkout - the previous version of the commit should be under HEAD@{1}
git reset --hard HEAD@{1}
###
git reflog records where you have been previously. You can find any commit you have been on with
this tool and find commits that you have lost accidentally (i.e. by rebase, amend).

There are even more powerful selectors. Do you want to know what you were been working on yesterday?
git show -q HEAD@{1.day.ago}
