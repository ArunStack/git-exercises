git rebase --onto allows you to move a branch to a different place.

You should have executed:
git rebase issue-555 --onto your-master

That means:
Get all commits that are not in issue-555 and place them onto your-master branch.

It is consistent with regular rebase (--onto defaults to branch you are rebasing to), i.e.:
git rebase issue-555
means: Get all commits that are not in issue-555 and place them onto issue-555.
