###

Because the branches have diverged, fast-forward merge strategy could not be applied.
Therefore, merge conflict was possible. Because two branches made changes in the same
file and near the same line, Git decided not to handle the situation itself but to
throw a merge commit (letting user decide what to do).

A lot of hints of how to merge conflict has been written in the README.md file.
