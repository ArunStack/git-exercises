Basically, there are two main ways of passing this exercise.

The first one is rebase. You want to rebase change-branch-history branch
on the hot-bugfix branch by
git rebase hot-bugfix
This results in the situation presented in Readme.md.

The second one is cherry-pick. You can cherry-pick your work on the
hot-bugfix branch with
git checkout hot-bugfix
git cherry-pick change-branch-history
This results in the same commit history of the change-branch-history
branch but the overall result is different than after rebase. When
cherry-picking, the hot-bugfix branch is moved forward and it points
to the same commit as change-branch-history. Be aware of that.

Note that you should rebase commits when you have published them already.
