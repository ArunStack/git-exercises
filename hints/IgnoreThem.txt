###
A .gitignore file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.

To ignore all files with specific string inside filename, just type it in, i.e. dumb
To ignore all files with specific extension use wildcard, i.e. *.exe
To ignore the whole directories, put a slash in the end of the rule, i.e. libraries/
To specify full path from the .gitignore location start rule with slash, i.e. /libraries

Note that there is a difference between libraries/ rule and /libraries/ rule.
The first one would ignore all directories named "libraries" in the whole project whereas
the second one would ignore only the "libraries" directory in the same location as .gitignore file.
